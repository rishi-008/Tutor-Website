- **Project Live Demo:** [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4kNH7HaTiQ)

## Project Overview
The Tutor Website is designed to provide an intuitive and efficient platform for online tutoring. Currently, the frontend has been fully developed and deployed using **Netlify**. The backend is in progress, utilizing **Netlify Functions**, but is facing some challenges in implementation.

> **Note:** The website is currently frontend-only as backend functionality is under development. Ongoing efforts are being made to integrate backend services to achieve full functionality.

## Architectural Structure
The application follows a hybrid **Client-Server** model while incorporating elements of **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** and **Layered Architecture** to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

## Next Steps
- **Backend Development:** Continue working on Netlify Functions to integrate backend functionality.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Implement secure login/signup features.
- **Database Integration:** Establish a robust database connection for user and session management.
- **Performance Optimization:** Enhance loading speeds and optimize API calls.

This project demonstrates a structured approach to building an online tutoring platform, emphasizing modular architecture and scalability. Further updates will be provided as backend development progresses.
